    Training Data 
    #####################################
    
    A. Choosing a model:
        1. For Structured Data:
                CatBoost
                XGBoost
                Random Forest
                Decision Tree
        2. For Unstructred Data:
                Deep Learning
                Transfer Learning
                Neural Networks
    
    B. Training a model:
        X(Data)
        y(Label)
        Goal: Minimise time between experiments
            Accuracy-> 87.5% (3min)....91.3%(92min)...94.7%(176min)


    Validation Data 
    #############################

        1. Machine learning models have hyperparameter you can adjust 
        2. A models first result aren't its last
        3. Tuning can take place on training or validation data sets
        
    
    Comparison/Test Data
    ##############################

    How will our model perform in the real world?

        Good Model:
            A good model would yield similar result in Training, Validation  and Test set
            Data Set    Performance
            Training    98%
            Test        96%

        Underfitting (potential)
            Data Set    Performance
            Training    64% (Precision is higher)
            Test        47%
                Due to Data mismatch
                    Fixing: 
                        a. Try a more advanced model
                        b. Increase model hyperparameters
                        c. Reduce amount of Features
                        d. Train longer


        Overfitting (potential)
            Data Set    Performance
            Training    93%
            Test        99% (Accuracy is higher)
                Due to Data leakage
                    Fixing:
                        a. Collect more data
                        b. Try less advanced model

        
6. Experimentations:-
    How could we improve/What can we try next?
